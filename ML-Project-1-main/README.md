# ML-Project-1

You have to add :
- data/dataset/x_test.csv
- data/dataset/x_train.csv
- data/dataset/y_train.csv

And run all the cells of run.ipynb to produce the predictions.csv file
Furthermore if you're curious about the choice of hyperparameters you can check out the cross_val.ipynb notebook to see how they were obtained (warning, running the logistic GD will take some time due to cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning happening at once !)
